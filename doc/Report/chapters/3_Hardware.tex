\section{Circuit diagrams}
See Appendix \ref{appendix:circuits} for all circuit diagrams pertaining to the car. Please note that while it is not immediately obvious from the diagrams, the two batteries are in fact connected in parallel (through the \"nano\" FPGAs no less!) so make sure that before using the car, \textbf{both batteries are fully charged, and have the same potential difference across the terminals!!} Otherwise, there will be large currents flowing between the batteries when they attempt to level out. In the best case, these will reduce the battery lifetime, in the worst case, they may burn out the FPGA boards. I would suggest that next semester's group take a look at the wiring in general, too.
