\chapter{Conclusion}
As the project goals were slightly changing over the lab course semester and the possible work and amount of ideas to be realized got into dimensions that could have filled many lab course semesters and not just one, we had to realize that we wont be able to build the perfect and completely stable Car2X platform without any bugs. We learned a lot of things aboout Software/Hardware co-design what includes a lot of time spent into looking for errors, bugs and hardware faults. This lead us to the decision to define our goal as getting the system far enough to run on our multicore FPGA and provide all the Car2X fatures in a way that it was possible to successfully test the functionalities in a way the positive results could be reproduced. This means that at the end we reached a state where the basic concept was successfully implemented and working BUT our result equals something comparable to an early developement prototype, meaning that there are definitely a lot of bugs and unhandeled cases making the car itself quite unstable in terms of reliability.\\ \\
Therefore we suggest to invest some decent amount of time into testing and optimizing the current state of the car because we sadly did not have the time to do that as well as we would have wanted to.
Also feel free to contact our group if you need some help. We know how hard it is to get into a previous' groups work...
