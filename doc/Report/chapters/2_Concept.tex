\section{Overview}
%% Johannes
The project can be divided into three main parts. At the fundamental level, is the hardware (the motors, wheels, batteries, FPGA boards, switch, etc). These form the wide constraints on what may be done with the car.

The next two parts are what was focused on this semester: the FPGA boards' hardware configuration and the software that runs on that hardware.
