/*
 * Class CCarMessage.
 * This class represents a single basic message. It consists of a message-header and a message-body.
 * The message-header is implemented in this super-class. Due to different body-types the body must
 * be implemented in the subclasses.
 *
 * Structure of a simple message:
 * 1st Byte | 2nd Byte | 3rd Byte | 4th Byte
 * ---------|----------|----------|-----------
 * Type     | Length   | SubType  | Flags
 *    P     A     Y     L     O     A     D
 *
 * Type is the ID of the message class. The type follows this rule:
 * Types between 0 and 3 are for NETWORKING (such as WelcomeMessage)
 * Types between 4 and 7 are BASIC messages and have to be understood by every networking client
 * Types between 8 and X are GENERAL purpose messages
 *
 * Length = Length of header (always 4 bytes) + Length of PAYLOAD
 * The Length of request and answer should always be identical!
 *
 * If a sensor requires more than one message type, SubType distinguishes between this messages.
 * Is there just one message type this field should be 0.
 *
 * Flags: Bits are numbered from 0 (least significant bit) to 7:
 * Bit 0:  Request(0) / Answer(1)
 * ...
