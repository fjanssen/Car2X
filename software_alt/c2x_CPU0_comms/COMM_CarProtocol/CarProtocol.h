/*
* Class CCarProtocol.
* This class manages the complete communication protocol. Each protocol object consists of a protocol-header
* and a list of messages (see CarMessage).
*
* Note: Due to some renaming conflicts there are the following synonyms:
* CarProtocol = Packet
* CarMessage = Message
* The fields in CarProtocol and CarMessage may have the same name. Make sure that you are in the right class!
*
* The total structure of a packet looks like:
*
* 1st Byte | 2nd Byte | 3rd Byte | 4th Byte
* ---------|----------|----------|-----------
* 'C' | 'A' | 'R' | 'P'
* PacketNumber | PayloadLength
* ---------|----------|----------|-----------
* P A Y L O A D
*
* 'C''A''R''P': Start sequence of the packet to detect a packet in the incoming byte-stream.
* PacketNumber: Consecutive increasing 16 bit number which works as an ID. The number is never changed by the
* Nios2, only by the central ECU (Linux-PC). Thereby the central ECU can detect a protocol fail
* if the response packet has not the same PacketNumber as the request packet.
* Please remember the wrap around after the PacketNumber 65535!
* PayloadLength: Total length of the payload in Bytes. This length information contains not the packet-header length!
*
* The payload contains at least one message and max. 8 messages. All messages start at a multiple of 4 assuming
* that all messages have a multiple of 4 as length. There must be no gap between two messages!!
*
*
* The order of the messages in a packet is important:
* Contains the packet a WelcomeMessage this message as to be the first. All other messages in this packet will
* be ignored!
*
* Otherwise the first message is the most important followed by the second and so on... See main.cpp for the
* meaning of important.
* Note: As the velocity-message is the most important in normal mode it will be assumed to be the first message!
* See also the main file for possible side-effects on the speed control.
